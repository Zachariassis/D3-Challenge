# D3-Challenge

This project observed healthcare information about each state in the US. Data used in this analysis were average age, income, and poverty level of at risk individuals. This included obesity and smoking. 

An interactive graphic was created in javascript using d3. This can be run through the index.html in this project. By selecting any of the 6 metrics (3 on the x-axis, 3 on the y-axis) the user can switch between each measure for comparison. Each dot on the graph represents each specific state and is labeled as such.
